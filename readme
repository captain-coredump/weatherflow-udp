This is a driver for weewx, that captures data from the WeatherFlow bridge
via the bridge's UDP broadcasts on the local subnet.

I believe that I have correctly followed the instructions provided by weewx
in order to provide the complete weewx extension package layout here.

https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/extensions#how-to-install-an-extension

Installation should be as simple as grabbing a .ZIP download of this
entire project from the GitHub web interface, and then running this
command:

wee_extension --install weatherflow-udp-master.zip

Worst case, a manual install is simple enough.  At least on my Raspberry Pi,
copy weatherflowudp.py from bin/user to /usr/share/weewx/user/weatherflowudp.py,
and then edit /etc/weewx/weewx.conf and add the new station driver settings
per the info below.

Please let me know if I made a mistake with the packaging.  I am not a weewx
expert, and do not claim to be a programmer or more than a casual user of
GitHub.

Description:

This driver detects different sensors packets broadcast using the WeatherFlow
UDP JSON protocol, and it includes a mechanism to filter the incoming data
and map the filtered data onto the weewx database schema and identify the
type of data from each sensor.

Sensors are filtered based on a tuple that identifies uniquely each sensor.
A tuple consists of the observation name, a unique identifier for the hardware,
and the packet type, separated by periods:

  <observation_name>.<hardware_id>.<packet_type>

The filter and data types are specified in a sensor_map stanza in the driver
stanza in your weewx.conf file.  For example:

[WeatherFlowUDP]
    driver = user.weatherflowudp
    log_raw_packets = False
    udp_address = <broadcast>
    # udp_address = 0.0.0.0
    # udp_address = 255.255.255.255
    udp_port = 50222
    udp_timeout = 90

    [[sensor_map]]
        outTemp = air_temperature.AR-00004444.obs_air
        outHumidity = relative_humidity.AR-00004444.obs_air
        pressure =  station_pressure.AR-00004444.obs_air
        # lightning_strikes =  lightning_strike_count.AR-00004444.obs_air
        # avg_distance =  lightning_strike_avg_distance.AR-00004444.obs_air
        outTempBatteryStatus =  battery.AR-00004444.obs_air
        windSpeed = wind_speed.SK-00001234.rapid_wind
        windDir = wind_direction.SK-00001234.rapid_wind
        # lux = illuminance.SK-00001234.obs_sky
        UV = uv.SK-00001234.obs_sky
        rain = rain_accumulated.SK-00001234.obs_sky
        windBatteryStatus = battery.SK-00001234.obs_sky
        radiation = solar_radiation.SK-00001234.obs_sky
        # lightningYYY = distance.AR-00004444.evt_strike
        # lightningZZZ = energy.AR-00004444.evt_strike

==> If no sensor_map is specified, no data will be collected! <==

To identify sensors, use the option 'log_raw_packets = True' to
output all raw received packets into syslog where you can examine
what is being sent.  Make sure to set 'log_raw_packets = False'
when done, since it will generate a LOT of syslog entries over
time.

To identify the various observation_name options, start weewx
with this station driver installed and it will write the
entire matrix of available observation_names and sensor_types
to syslog (or wherever weewx is configured to send log info).

Apologies for the long observation_names, but I figured that
it would be best if I used the documented field names from
WeatherFlow's UDP packet specs (v37 at the time of writing) 
with underscores between words so that the names were
consistent with their protocol documentation.  See
https://weatherflow.github.io/SmartWeather/api/udp.html

Options:

    log_raw_packets = False

    Enable writing all raw UDP packets received to syslog,
    (or wherever weewx is configured to send log info).  Will
    fill up your logs pretty quickly, so only use it as
    a debugging tool or to identify sensors.
     
    udp_address = <broadcast>
    # udp_address = 0.0.0.0
    # udp_address = 255.255.255.255

    This is the broadcast address that we should be listening
    on for packets.  If the driver throws an error on start,
    try one of the other commented-out options (in order).
    This seems to be platform-specific.  All three work on
    Debian Linux and my Raspberry Pi, but only 0.0.0.0 works
    on my Macbook running OS-X or MacOS.  Don't ask about
    Windows, since I don't have a test platform to see
    if it will even work.

    udp_port = 50222

    The IP port that we should be listening for UDP packets
    from.  WeatherFlow's default is 50222.

    udp_timeout = 90

    The number of seconds that we should wait for an incoming
    packet on the UDP socket before we give up and log an
    error into syslog.  I cannot determine whether or not
    weewx cares whether a station driver is non-blocking or
    blocking, but encountered a situation in testing where
    the WeatherFlow Hub rebooted for a firmware update and
    it caused the driver to throw a timeout error and exit.
    I have no idea what the default timeout value even is, but
    decided to make it configurable in case it is important
    to someone else.  My default of 90 seconds seems reasonable,
    with the Air sending observations every 60 seconds.  If
    you are an old-school programmer like me who thinks that
    computers should wait forever until they receive data,
    the Python value "None" should disable the timeout.  In
    any case, the driver will just log an error into syslog
    and keep on processing.  It isn't like it is the end
    of the world if you pick a wrong value, but you may have
    a better chance of missing packets during the brief error
    trapping time with a really short duration.

Finally, let me add a thank you to Matthew Wall for the sensor map naming
logic that I borrowed from his weewx-SDR station driver code: 

https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-sdr

I guess that I should also thank David St. John and the "dream team" at
WeatherFlow for all of the hard work and forethought that they put into
making this weather station a reality.  I can't sing enough praises for
whoever came up with the idea to send observation packets out live via UDP
broadcasts, and think that they should be nominated for a Nobel Prize or
something.

This is the part where I am supposed to put in a PayPal link and ask for
donations if you find this code useful.  Since I am financially solvent (and
would starve to death if I had to make a living as a programmer), :-)  I would
like to encourage anyone reading this to make a small donation to a local
not-for-profit school, hospital, animal shelter, or other charity of your
choice who appreciates philanthropic support.
